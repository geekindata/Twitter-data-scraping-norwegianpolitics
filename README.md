  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project aims to understand the social connections among Norwegian politicians through their Twitter activity during the 2021 Norwegian election. Twitter is a popular platform for both the public and politicians to obtain political information and engage with each other. This research mainly focuses on the relationships, interactions and different patterns among Norwegian politiciansâ€™ social networks shown on Twitter.</p>
    <p>Through both quantitative and visual analysis, this research offers insights into the strategies that Norwegian politicians may adopt regarding the embeddedness of social media. The network consists of the 169 Stortinget representatives, elected in 2021. The project compares their two different types of social behaviour and strategies on Twitter, through exploring their Twitter networking pattern of 'following' and 'mentioning' relationships.</p>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>We used Twitter API to scrape data from Twitter accounts of Norwegian politicians. The data collected includes their followers, mentions, and the accounts they follow. We then used this data to construct a network of social connections between these politicians.</p>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>This project contains several files, including the data collected through Twitter API and the results of the analysis. Here is a brief summary of the files:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project provides insights into the social connections among Norwegian politicians on Twitter during the 2013 Norwegian election. The analysis shows that there are clear patterns and strategies in the way these politicians interact with each other on social media. This project demonstrates the potential of using social media data for political research and understanding the social dynamics of politics.</p>
